# dictionaryApp
This application is made up of two parts, one with the client input and the other is displaying results. 

 - At whatever point a client looks for a word, we store that contribution to a state and trigger an API call dependent on the looked through watchword boundary. 
 - After that when the API call is made, store that API reaction in another state variable.
